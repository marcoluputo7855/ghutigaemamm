                We have, indeed, been turning various ceramic cache pots into planters by drilling holes in the. Once the pot is saturated, place a piece of tape over the spot you plan to drill through to prevent the drill bit from slipping. Insert hole saw into drill and take the adhesive backing off one of the templates, place it on the hole saw guide, aligning the notches.

    <h3>If you need to drill a hole in ceramic tile, you could chuck a masonry bit in your cordless drill and watch as the tip of the bit skates around on the glazed surface, ruining the tile, but there&#039;s a better way.</h3>
    <p>I&#039;ve got some orchid pots/general ceramic pots/containers that don&#039;t have holes that i&#039;d like to. If you need to drill a hole in ceramic tile, you could chuck a masonry bit in your cordless drill and watch as the tip of the bit skates around on the glazed surface, ruining the tile, but there&#039;s a better way. Drilling a hole in ceramic or terra cotta pots is so easy to do! Found the perfect pot without drainage holes?</p>
