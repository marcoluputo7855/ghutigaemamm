                You can use standard drill bits.many claim they drill ceramicâ€¦but they will be blunt rapidly as the cutting edge of a normal drill bit as very small and ceramic is very tough! Apply light pressure as you drill at the slowest speed. I suggest drilling from the outside in rather than the other way around because it&#039;ll chip a little as the bit goes through.
